# Vue.js Contact Form   

The intention of this small project was try out a few features of Vue.js, while also connecting to an API running on a Node.js back-end with a MongoDB database. I created the front-end, while the back-end was sourced.

Main points of Interest:
-   Pulling the data from the API (services > contact.js);
-   Being able to use the full CRUD / manipulate the date through the front-end;
-   Two Vue components with specific Vue syntax like v-model, @click.prevent, etc;
-   Using computed properties to hide a button based on a specific condition.
